# Tweeter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a logistic regression model applied to a Twitter dataset. Sentiment analysis is a valuable task in natural language processing, and this project aims to classify tweets into positive and negative sentiments.

## Key Features

- Utilizes logistic regression for sentiment classification.
- Text preprocessing techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model optimization.
- Evaluation of model performance on training and test sets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, keras, gensim, matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FasilHameed/Tweeter-Sentiment_Analysis-ML-NLP-.git
    cd Tweeter-Sentiment_Analysis-ML-NLP-
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data and train the logistic regression model:

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

2. Evaluate the model on the test set:

    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```
